# Modular Forms

Modular Forms is a JavaScript library built on [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) to validate and handle various types of forms. It is type-safe, fast by default and the bundle size is small due to a modular design. Try it out in our [playground](https://modularforms.dev/playground)!
This project is a fork of [modular-forms](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/modular-forms) by Fabian Hiller, with the main goal to remove the dependency on Qwik City to allow integration into Astro projects by Gideon Gaida.
